# DJS03 Project: Book Connect - Abstractions

## Introduction

For this assignment, I had to apply objects and methods for abstraction to rework an application that was already completely functional. Improving the readability, extendibility, and maintainability of the code is the main goal of this project.

### Project Overview

Creating more generic functions, applying abstraction to conceal the complicated reality and expose only the portions that were required, restructuring the current code to improve its structure, producing understandable comments and documentation, and adhering to the style guides were the tasks assigned to me.

#### Tasks

1. Code Analysis
2. Plan Refactoring
3. Implement Abstraction
4. Enhance Functionality
5. Documentation and Comments
6. Adherence to Styleguides

## Elements Included

**Book Rendering:** Using methods to generate book elements, render books, and add authors and genres.
**Class Initialisation:** Initialising the `books`, `authors`, `genres`, and `booksPerPage` with the `BookStore` class.
**Event Listeners:** Using methods to include event listeners in user interactions, including settings, search, and opening book information.
**Filtering:** Using methods to filter books based on search criteria.
**Pagination:** Using methods to handle pagination.
**Theme Management:** Using methods to modify and configure the theme in accordance with user or system preferences.

## Reflections

### Areas of Mastery

**Conditional Logic:** My ability to utilise conditional statements helped me manage UI state changes, including applying filters, and opening and closing overlays.
**Event Handling:** This project allowed me to controll how users interact with the programme, through event handling.
**Modular Code Design:** Took the time to break down the functionality into small, reusable methods (abstraction)

## Challenges Faced

Some of the challenges have been debugging the implementation of the opening and closing of the `openBookDetail` overlay, managing event propagation in a complicated DOM structure to guarantee that they're handled correctly without unwanted side effects. As well as efficiently rendering a large number of books and updating the DOM without causing performance issues.

## Overall Learning Experience

Academically speaking, this project emphasized the value of designing a user-friendly interface with accessible and responsive design; reaffirmed the need of developing modular, maintainable code, and followed best practices for project organisation and coding.

Personally speaking, this project has been draining, frustrating, and demoralising but absolutely taught me that giving up is not an option when you have a deadline and to just do my best. Since we have only just begun and are barely at the beginning, I know that I'm still going to struggle and this was a great tester for my limits.
